	<h3>WELLY is born from the belief that pure water is essential to living well</h3>
	<p>When you drink from a WELLY bottle, your water will be purified in the palm of your hand<br>
	by a unique filter made from activated coconut shell carbon that removes chlorine,<br>
	particulates, and unpleasant tastes and odors.</p>

	<p>Bottle Includes:

		<div id="box1">
  		This text is enclosed in box1.

	 <ul id="list1">
			<li>1 coconut shell carbon filter</li>
			<li>Sustainably harvested bamboo panels</li>
			<li>1 filter replaces 300 plastic disposable bottles</li>
	 </ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>This is where WELLY lives</p>
